                <p>In the future, I would like to make my way up to a senior developer and help shape the projects that I would be working on. I would also like to then take the opportunity to help others who are in a similar position that I am in now.</p>

                    <p>I have experience using HTML and understand how it works, although I am still in the learning stage and experiencing new ways of using HTML.</p>

                    <p>I have a little bit of experience with CSS. I understand the basics of CSS and how it works. I understand that it works by the code being read top to bottom and if there is a duplicate it takes the last attribute. There are also ways in which you can make using CSS easier and more manageable with plugins like bootstrap, tailwind and others.</p>

                    <p>I have experience using PHP in many of the practice projects that I have made. I like that it has a lot of resources online to help learn and I find that I can usually find help quite easily if I do get stuck. I prefer using the Laravel framework as it makes setting up and getting started with the basics very quick and easy. It also makes writing and understanding database queries easier.</p>

                    <p>I converted an old Windows laptop into a server. I installed Ubuntu Server on it. I use Docker to install services that I want to run. Currently, I use it to host my Home Assistant container, Plex container and I have connected my printer to it so that I can print from any device on the network. I plan to upgrade my server by creating a dedicated NAS server which I will then be able to more safely host files on using RAID. I am also a fan of trying to limit using the 'cloud' as much as possible and this will be a big step towards it.</p>
